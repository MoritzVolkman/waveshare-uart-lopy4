The purpose of this project is to display upcoming events from an Outlook calendar on an eInk Display, specifically the Waveshare 4.3 Inch ePaper display. 

In the folder waveshare, you can find a driver for Micropython devices for the use of the Waveshare UART 4.3 inch ePaper display. It is based on the driver for Raspberry Pi by jarret which you can find [here](https://github.com/jarret/raspi-uart-waveshare).
